# Anomaly cancellation in Lean 4 
Copyright: Joseph Tooby-Smith 

As a proof-of-concept of the use of lean 4 in high energy physics, we create a lean-4 project of results related to annomaly cancellation in physics. My aim is to slowly expand it other areas of high energy physics. 

## Installation

### Installing Lean 4
