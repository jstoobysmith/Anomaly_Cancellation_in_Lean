# Anomaly cancellation in Lean 4 
Copyright: Joseph Tooby-Smith 

As a proof-of-concept of the use of lean 4 in high energy physics, we create a lean-4 project of results related to annomaly cancellation in physics. My aim is to slowly expand it other areas of high energy physics. 

## Installation

### Installing Lean 4 

See: https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html

### Quick installation 

1. Clone this repository. 
2. Open a terminal in the cloned directory. 
2. Run `lake -Kenv=dev update`.

Depending on how upto date this directory is compared to MathLib4 this may lead to errors.
